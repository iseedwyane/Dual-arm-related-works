## [1987 Adaptive control strategies for cooperative dual‐arm manipulators]
The article describes three strategies for adaptive control of cooperative dual‐arm robots. In the position‐position control strategy, the adaptive controllers ensure that the end‐effector positions of both arms track desired trajectories in Cartesian space despite unknown time‐varying interaction forces exerted through the load. In the position‐hybrid control strategy, the adaptive controller of one arm controls end‐effector motions in the free directions and applied forces in the constraint directions; while the adaptive controller of the other arm ensures that the end‐effector tracks desired position trajectories. In the hybrid‐hybrid control strategy, the adaptive controllers ensure that both end‐effectors track reference position trajectories while simultaneously applying desired forces on the load. In all three control strategies, the coupling effects between the arms through the load are treated as “disturbances” which are rejected by the adaptive controllers while following desired commands in a common frame of reference. The adaptive controllers do not require the complex mathematical model of the arm dynamics or any knowledge of the arm dynamic parameters or the load parameters such as mass and stiffness. The controllers have simple structures and are computationally fast for on‐line implementation with high sampling rates. Simulation results are given to illustrate the proposed adaptive control strategies.
本文介绍了三种协作式双臂机器人的自适应控制策略。在位置-位置控制策略中，尽管通过负载施加了未知的时变相互作用力，但自适应控制器可确保两个手臂的末端执行器位置在笛卡尔空间中跟踪所需的轨迹。在位置混合控制策略中，一只手臂的自适应控制器控制末端执行器在自由方向上的运动和在约束方向上的作用力。另一臂的自适应控制器可确保末端执行器跟踪所需的位置轨迹。在混合动力混合控制策略中，自适应控制器可确保两个末端执行器都跟踪参考位置轨迹，同时在负载上施加所需的力。在所有三种控制策略中，将臂之间通过负载的耦合效应视为“干扰”，当遵循公共参照系中的所需命令时，自适应控制器会拒绝这些干扰。自适应控制器不需要复杂的机械臂动力学数学模型，也不需要任何机械臂动力学参数或负载参数（例如质量和刚度）的知识。控制器具有简单的结构，并且计算速度快，可以高采样率在线实施。仿真结果表明了所提出的自适应控制策略。
## [1994 The cooperative dual-arm cam-lock manipulators](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/351310)
Recent developments in the area of smart structures indicate that variable geometry/stiffness truss network is of fundamental importance in designing smart transformable structures and systems. This paper presents the conceptual designs and dynamics modeling of a cooperative dual-arm robotics structure, called the dual-arm cam-lock manipulator. The manipulator is capable of performing a wide variety of tasks by automatically re-configuring itself to form a variable geometry, stiffness, and workspace robotics structure. Hence, it may also be referred to as a variable geometry robot manipulator.

## [1998 Conceptual design and dynamics modeling of a cooperative dual-arm cam-lock manipulator]
This paper presents the conceptual designs, kinematics and dynamics modeling of a cooperative re-configurable Dual-Arm Cam-Lock Manipulator. A cam-lock manipulator is a robotics structure with a pair of multi-degree of freedom planar arms jointed together at a shared base. This manipulator is designed to be capable of performing a wide variety of tasks by automatically re-configuring itself to form a variable geometry, stiffness, damping, and workspace robotics structure by the virtue of a novel link/joint design along i''s arms, labeled as the cam-lock design. The kinematics and dynamics of this manipulator is described using admissible variables (i.e., variables that define the constrained admissible motion). Along with the dynamic relations of this manipulator, a generic equation was also developed for the joint servo system.

## [2000 Robust control of planar dual-arm cooperative manipulators](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0736584599000435)
A robust control method is developed for a planar dual-arm manipulator system. Contact and friction constraints for grasp conditions are considered. An optimization algorithm is developed such that a minimization of the energy consumed by the participating arms subject to equality and inequality constraints of grasp and friction constraints. The necessary Karush–Kun–Tucker conditions are implemented to characterize admissible solutions. A robust controller is proposed using a switching-sliding algorithm for modeling imprecision and disturbances. The switching-sliding mode is then replaced by a saturation function that results in the elimination of the fundamental cause for control chatter. The formulation presents a control algorithm that is well suited for dual-arm cooperative manipulators.

## [2004 Cooperative Control of a 3D Dual-Flexible-Arm Robot](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/B:JINT.0000010794.37580.3a)
This paper discusses cooperative control of a dual-flexible-arm robot to handle a rigid object in three-dimensional space. The proposed control scheme integrates hybrid position/force control and vibration suppression control. To derive the control scheme, kinematics and dynamics of the robot when it forms a closed kinematic chain is discussed. Kinematics is described using workspace force, velocity and position vectors, and hybrid position/force control is extended from that on dual-rigid-arm robots. Dynamics is derived from constraint conditions and the lumped-mass-spring model of the flexible robots and an object. The vibration suppression control is calculated from the deflections of the flexible links and the dynamics. Experiments on cooperative control are performed. The absolute positions/orientations and internal forces/moments are controlled using the robot, each arm of which has two flexible links, seven joints and a force/torque sensor. The results illustrate that the robot handled the rigid object damping links' vibration successfully in three-dimensional space.

## [2008 Six-DOF Impedance Control of Dual-Arm Cooperative Manipulators](http://sci-hub.tw/https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/4639601)
Abstract—In this paper, the problem of impedance control of dual-arm cooperative manipulators is studied. A general
impedance control scheme is adopted, which encompasses a centralized impedance control strategy, aimed at conferring
a compliant behavior at the object level, and a decentralized impedance control, enforced at the end-effector level, aimed at
avoiding large internal loading of the object. Remarkably, the mechanical impedance behavior is defined in terms of geometrically
consistent stiffness. The overall control scheme is based on a twoloop arrangement, where a simple proportional integral derivative
inner motion loop is adopted for each manipulator, while an outer loop, using force and moment measurements at the robots
wrists, is aimed at imposing the desired impedance behaviors. The developed control scheme is experimentally tested on a dual-arm
setup composed of two 6-DOF industrial manipulators carrying a common object. The experimental investigation concerns the
four different controller configurations that can be achieved by activating/deactivating the single impedance controllers.

## [2012 Dual arm manipulation—A survey](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S092188901200108X)
Recent advances in both anthropomorphic robots and bimanual industrial manipulators had led to an increased interest in the specific problems pertaining to dual arm manipulation. For the future, we foresee robots performing human-like tasks in both domestic and industrial settings. It is therefore natural to study specifics of dual arm manipulation in humans and methods for using the resulting knowledge in robot control. The related scientific problems range from low-level control to high level task planning and execution. This review aims to summarize the current state of the art from the heterogenous range of fields that study the different aspects of these problems specifically in dual arm manipulation.

## [2013 An impedance-based control architecture for multi-robot cooperative dual-arm mobile manipulation](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6696370)
Abstract:
Cooperative manipulation in robotic teams likely results in an increased manipulation performance due to complementary sensing and actuation capabilities or increased redundancy. However, a precise coordination of the involved manipulators is required in order to avoid undesired stress on the manipulated object. Extending the workspace of the robots by means of mobile platforms greatly enlarges the potential task spectrum but simultaneously poses new challenges for example in terms of increased kinematic errors. In this paper we show how kinematic errors in the closed kinematic chain originating from uncertainties in the geometry of object and manipulators limit the cooperative task performance. We extend an impedance-based coordination control scheme towards mobile multi-robot manipulation to limit undesired internal forces in the presence of kinematic uncertainties. Furthermore, we employ a task-space decoupling approach to reduce the impact of disturbances at the mobile platforms on the end effectors. The presented control scheme for cooperative, mobile dualarm manipulation is applicable in real-time and suitable for a team of heterogeneous manipulators. We evaluate the presented architecture by means of a large-scale experiment with four 7DoF manipulators on two mobile platforms.
由于互补的感测和致动能力或增加的冗余性，机器人团队中的合作操纵可能会提高可操纵性。但是，需要对所涉及的操纵器进行精确协调，以避免对被操纵物体施加不希望的压力。通过移动平台扩展机器人的工作空间极大地扩展了潜在任务的范围，但同时也带来了新的挑战，例如运动误差增加。在本文中，我们显示了闭合运动链中的运动错误是如何由对象和机械手几何形状的不确定性如何限制协作任务的执行而产生的。我们将基于阻抗的协调控制方案扩展到移动多机器人机动技术，以在存在运动学不确定性的情况下限制不希望的内力。此外，我们使用任务空间解耦方法来减少干扰对末端执行器上的移动平台的影响。所提出的用于协作式移动双臂操纵的控制方案可以实时应用，并且适用于一组异构操纵器。我们通过在两个移动平台上使用四个7DoF机器人的大规模实验，评估了所提出的体系结构。
## [2016 Redundancy analysis of cooperative dual-arm manipulators](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1729881416657754)
This paper presents the redundancy analysis of two cooperative manipulators, showing how they can be considered as a single redundant manipulator through the use of the relative Jacobian matrix. In this way, the kinematic redundancy can be resolved by applying the principal local optimization techniques used in the single manipulator case. We resolve the redundancy by using the Jacobian null space technique, which permits us to perform several tasks with different execution priority levels at the same time; this is a useful feature, especially when the manipulators are to be mounted on and cooperate with a mobile platform. As an illustrative example, we present a case study consisting of two planar manipulators mounted on a smart wheelchair, whose degrees of redundancy are employed to move an object along a pre-defined path, while avoiding an obstacle in the manipulator’s workspace at the same time.
本文介绍了两个协作机械手的冗余分析，展示了如何通过使用相对雅可比矩阵将它们视为单个冗余机械手。这样，可以通过应用在单个操纵器情况下使用的主要局部优化技术来解决运动学冗余。我们使用雅可比零空间技术解决了冗余问题，该技术使我们能够同时执行具有不同执行优先级的多个任务。这是一个有用的功能，特别是在将操纵器安装在移动平台上并与移动平台配合使用时。作为说明性示例，我们提出一个案例研究，该案例研究由安装在智能轮椅上的两个平面操纵器组成，其冗余度用于沿预定路径移动对象，同时避免在操纵器工作空间中出现障碍物。

## [2019 Trajectory Tracking Control Design for Dual-Arm Robots Using Dynamic Surface Controller](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8646243)
This paper presents a dynamic surface controller (DSC) for dual arm manipulator (DAM) tracking desired trajectories. The DSC algorithm is based on backstepping technique and multiple sliding surface control principle, but with an important addition. In the design of DSC, low-pass filters are included which prevent the complexity arising due to the “explosion of terms” i.e. the number of terms in the control law rapidly gets out of hand. The proposed controller is simulated on complex kinetic dynamic model of a four degrees of freedom (DOF) dual-arm robot. Moreover, the stability of the control system is proved by using Lyapunov theory. The simulation results show the effectiveness of the controller which provide precise tracking performance of the manipulator.
本文提出了一种动态表面控制器（DSC），用于双臂机械手（DAM）跟踪所需轨迹。 DSC算法基于反步技术和多滑动面控制原理，但有重要的补充。在DSC的设计中，包括了低通滤波器，可防止由于“项爆炸”而引起的复杂性，即控制律中的项数迅速失控。该控制器是在四自由度（DOF）双臂机器人的复杂动力学模型上进行仿真的。此外，利用李雅普诺夫理论证明了控制系统的稳定性。仿真结果显示了控制器的有效性，该控制器提供了机械手的精确跟踪性能。
## [2019 Deep Grasping Prediction with Antipodal Loss for Dual Arm Manipulators]
The cooperative manipulators can execute a wide range of tasks, such as carrying large or heavy payloads, which are difficult for a single manipulator. Dual arm manipulators are in typically operative configuration to mimic human, which are of highly flexibility and dexterity. In this paper, we propose a novel coarse-to-fine deep learning model along with investigating the grasp prior loss based on the well-known antipodal force-closure property. The proposed deep learning model predicts the contact configurations in grasping over-loaded and over-sized objects for dual arm manipulators directly from raw RGB images. We first apply detection network to locate the coarse bounding box of objects, further apply a fine-predicting network on the bounding box clipped images to precisely generate two contact configurations via minimizing regression loss and the antipodal grasp prior loss. Extensive experimental results under dense clutter and occlusion strongly demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method.
协作机械手可以执行各种任务，例如携带较大或较重的有效载荷，这对于单个机械手来说是困难的。双臂机械手通常具有模仿人类的操作配置，具有高度的灵活性和灵活性。在本文中，我们提出了一种新颖的从粗到精的深度学习模型，并基于已知的对偶力闭合特性研究了抓取先验损失。拟议的深度学习模型可直接从原始RGB图像中预测双臂机械手抓取超载和超大物体时的接触配置。我们首先应用检测网络来定位对象的粗略边界框，再在边界框裁剪的图像上应用精细预测网络，以通过最小化回归损失和对映体把握先验损失来精确生成两个接触配置。在密集的杂波和遮挡下的大量实验结果有力地证明了该方法的有效性和鲁棒性。
# [2019 Dual-arm cooperative manipulation based on differential evolution ]
Cooperative manipulation in dual-arm robotic systems is a fundamental capability to perform many problems such as human-like tasks. In this article, we present an approach to solve dual-arm cooperative manipulation tasks using the differential evolution algorithm. In this work, manipulator kinematics are represented using the Denavit–Hartenberg model. The proposed method is able to avoid singularities because it does not require the inversion of any Jacobian matrix. In addition, the proposed approach handles joint limit constraints based on penalty functions. As a final remark, this approach is suitable for robotic systems of redundant or non-redundant serial manipulators composed of revolute or prismatic joints. Simulation experiments illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach under different dual-arm configurations. Furthermore, real experiments were performed using a dual-arm KUKA Youbot system to show the applicability of the proposed approach.
